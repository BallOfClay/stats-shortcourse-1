Getting started
======================================

Where are we going?
----------------------

Sure we mentioned machine learning---here is a figure that provides some perspective.

.. figure:: sklearn-map.png
   :scale: 35%
   :align: center
   :alt: galvanize-logo
   :figclass: align-center

`<http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map>`_

We cannot get there without some fundamental knowledge of programming and statistics.

Installing Python
-------------------

For the programming part...

If you want to follow along with the examples and because Python is
the working language of the Data Science Immersive we encourage you to
install Python.

`<https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>`_

Installing an editor
-----------------------

There are many editors to choose from... Unless you have a programming editor that you are already comfortable with try using Atom.

.. note:: programming practices, editors, version control, software engineering, and other related topics are not part of the scope of this shortcourse
