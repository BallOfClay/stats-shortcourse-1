Where do we want to be with machine learning algorithms
--------------------------------------------------------

**Algorithms are not just black boxes**

  * Know when is it appropriate to use the algorithms/tools
  * Provide enough resources so that:
     * Can you explain what the algorithm is doing in plain English?
     * Can you implement a simple version from the ground up?
	    
.. note:: the last point may be more difficult for some algorithms, but we will provide you with the resources to follow up on this.
	      
Resources for further study
